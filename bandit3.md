The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

When you connect to the bandit3, you do the command 'ls' and you see the 'inhere' directory

Use the command 'cd inhere'. The cd (change directory) command is a fundamental utility in Linux that allows users to navigate between directories within the file system. 

It's a built-in shell command, which means it's integrated into the shell itself, rather than being a separate executable program.

Use the command 'ls' , nothing to appear because the file was hidden.

Use the command 'ls -a' to show all file include the hidden file
