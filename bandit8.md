The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once\

Before coming to the bandit8, we will introduce tool 'sort' and 'uniq'

The sort command in Linux is a powerful utility used to sort the lines of text files in various orders. It can sort alphabetically, numerically, by month, and even reverse the order. 

The command is versatile and can handle different file types, including tables and numeric data.

The uniq command in Linux is a command-line utility that is used to report or filter out repeated lines in a file. 

Essentially, uniq helps in detecting adjacent duplicate lines and can also delete these duplicate lines. It's important to note that uniq only filters out matching lines that are adjacent to each other, so the input file usually needs to be sorted before using uniq or you can use sort -u as an alternative

So that is the password for bandit9!
